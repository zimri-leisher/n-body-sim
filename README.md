# n-body-sim
n-body simulator with a bunch of random features!

Written in C++ and SDL, this is a 2D n-body simulator that allows you to spawn in new gravitational bodies and modify the velocities of existing ones.
It analyzes the orbit of gravitational bodies in real time, constantly adjusting them to be correct and display the correct conic section. 
The initial conditions include the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Luna, Mars and Jupiter all to scale.
